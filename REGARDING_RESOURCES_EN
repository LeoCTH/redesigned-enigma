extremely short version for people in a hurry:
the sound files are not here because i don't own them.
you can do whatever you want on the code but do not claim them your own.
i do own the other resources (lang/, models/, textures/) so don't distribute them without talking to me first.
just please. don't be a jerk who steals other people's hard work just to base tiktok memes on them.

tl;dr
I own the rights to the source code and the resources included within the mod EXCEPT for the audio files. The audio
files should only be used as placeholders for proper sound files that I could freely use and distribute.
Do whatever you want on the source code within the MIT License, but do not plagiarize my code and call it your own
under any circumstances. I own any other resources featured in this mod and I disallow distribution without permission.

The really long and serious version:

I do NOT own the sound resources for the current revisions of the mod. They are just some "royalty-free"
sound effects that I downloaded off of the Internet and they are only intended to act as placeholders before
acquiring proper audio resources and therefore NOT final, and should never be uploaded to GitHub without permission.

However, you could substitute the sound effects with your own files, as .ogg files, as the files are referred internally
by their path and filename.
The sounds files in question are:
sounds/ (root dir)
    fire/
        deagle.ogg  (Desert Eagle fire sfx)
        glock.ogg   (Auto Glock fire sfx)
    reload/
        deagle.ogg  (Desert Eagle reload sfx)

Just to wrap things up:
The main code (everything under src/main/kotlin/ and java/ if applicable) is licensed under the MIT License.
(Since I'm kind of a lazy f**k and I don't want to mess with other kinds of complicated licensing.)

I do have full rights to:
    - The language files (under src/resources/assets/redesignedenigma/lang/), whom I wrote myself in two languages:
      English and Simplified Chinese.
    - The model files (under src/resources/assets/redesignedenigma/models/item/ and block/), whom I created, textured,
      exported and minified myself using Blockbench (and a browser), with original .bbmodel model files fully intact.
    - The texture files (under src/resources/assets/redesignedenigma/textures/), whom I created to supplement the weapon
      models as of the time of writing.
