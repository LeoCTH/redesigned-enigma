I don't care.  

This is where I keep all my cool stuff, so this mod might appear weird to you at first.  
Current features:
- ~~Minor~~ tweaks to the Minecraft title screen, including
    - Hide "modded" signature (yknow, that `1.x.x/Fabric` thing in the bottom left corner?)
    - Minecraft <-> Minceraft switch (Activated when your mouse hovers over the letters EC/CE.)
-  A currently WIP hitscan weapons system
    - Modelled after Counter-Strike (and CS:GO in extension)
    - Simple hitscan algorithm
    - Damage calculations (WIP)
    - Detailed handmade models
    - Capable of fire and reload sound effects*
