About the audio files:
Since I currently don't own any sound effects that I can use for this purpose,
I am currently using alternative/stripped soundbites that should only be used for testing,
therefore they are not uploaded onto the GitHub repo.
I might replace the audio sources in the future, but for now you will have to substitute the missing sfxs with
files on your own.
Sorry for that.
